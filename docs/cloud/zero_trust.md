# Zero Trust

Zero Trust, as it applies to the cloud, is a security model that operates on the principle "never trust, always verify." It means that no one, whether inside or outside the organization, is trusted by default, and every access request must be rigorously verified before granting access.

Here's a breakdown of its application in the cloud context:

1. **Identity and Access Management (IAM):** Each user (or system) has specific roles and permissions. Access is granted based on strict policies, and these roles are continuously validated.

2. **Continuous Authentication:** Instead of just checking credentials at the point of access, verification continues throughout the session. This can help detect and halt any malicious activity during a session.

3. **Microsegmentation:** Cloud resources and services are segmented into smaller parts. This limits lateral movement if a malicious actor gains access to one segment, as they won't have access to the entire system.

4. **Encryption:** Data at rest and in transit is encrypted. Even if data is accessed or intercepted, it remains unintelligible without the decryption key.

5. **Logging and Analytics:** All activities and access requests in the cloud are logged. Analytics tools then scrutinize these logs in real-time to identify any unusual or suspicious behavior.

6. **Device Verification:** In addition to user authentication, the device from which an access request comes is also verified. This ensures that even if a user's credentials are compromised, access can be denied if the request comes from an unrecognized or insecure device.

7. **Least Privilege Access:** Users or systems are given the minimum levels of access necessary to perform their tasks. This reduces the potential damage of a breach as compromised accounts will have limited reach.

The main idea behind Zero Trust in the cloud is to ensure that even if perimeter defenses fail, unauthorized access is still prevented or limited through rigorous internal checks and balances. This is essential given the growing complexity and dynamic nature of cloud environments.
